# Kanban Board Task Management System - Project Development Overview

This project was developed as the final assignment for the CS50 course by Harvard on EdX 2024. It addresses the need for a robust and scalable task management system by transitioning from a static Excel spreadsheet to a SQL database, serving as the foundation for a web-based Kanban board application. The development process followed Agile methodology, allowing for iterative development and continuous feedback.

## Requirements and Objectives

- **Project Goal:** Develop a Kanban board task management system tailored for a grocery and consumer goods retailer with 28 points of sale.
- **Core Functionalities:**
  - Implement a Kanban board for task visualization and management.
  - Provide user authentication and secure access.
  - Enable CRUD operations and advanced filtering options for tasks.
- **Scope:** Create a web-based solution using Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Product Backlog

The initial product backlog outlined all features and tasks required to meet project objectives. Prioritized based on core functionalities needed for the Kanban board system:

1. **User Authentication:** Secure login, registration, and session management.
2. **Task Management:** CRUD operations for task creation, updating, and deletion.
3. **Kanban Board:** Dynamic Kanban board with drag-and-drop functionality.
4. **Filtering and Search:** Advanced filtering options for tasks by POS, status, and priority.
5. **Pagination:** Server-side pagination for efficient task display.

  - Create visual aids such as screenshots, diagrams, and flowcharts to support the presentation.

## Agile Development Practices and Methodology

Throughout the project, Agile principles and practices were implemented to ensure efficient progress and adaptability:
- **Incremental Delivery:** Each sprint produced a functional increment, providing a shippable product at the end of each iteration.
- **Continuous Feedback:** Regular reviews and testing were conducted at the end of each sprint to gather feedback.
- **Backlog Refinement:** The product backlog was continuously refined based on sprint outcomes and stakeholder input.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Emphasized writing tests for key functionalities before implementation to ensure reliability.
- **Modular Architecture:** The codebase was organized into reusable components to facilitate scalability and maintenance.

## Conclusion

The development of the Kanban board task management system followed Agile methodology, resulting in a robust, scalable, and user-friendly application. By breaking down the project into iterative sprints and focusing on continuous improvement, the final product successfully met all requirements and established a strong foundation for future enhancements.
