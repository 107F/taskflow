## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

1. **Open Terminal or Command Prompt**:
   - **Windows**: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
   - **macOS/Linux**: Open the Terminal application.

2. **Navigate to Desired Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/desired/directory
   ```

3. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
   - Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual Git repository URL.

4. **Navigate into the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd task-management-system
   ```

### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

1. **Ensure Virtual Environment is Active**:
   - The command prompt should display `(venv)` prefix.

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**:
   ```bash
   pip list
   ```
   - Confirm that all packages are installed without errors.

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

1. **Create a `.env` File** in the project root directory.

2. **Add the Following Variables**:
   ```env
   FLASK_ENV=production
   SECRET_KEY=<your_secret_key>
   DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///core/taskflow.db
   ```

3. **Generate a Secure `SECRET_KEY`**:
   ```bash
   python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(16))"
   ```
   - Replace `<your_secret_key>` with the generated value.

4. **Secure the `.env` File**:
   - Add `.env` to `.gitignore` to prevent it from being committed to version control.

### Step 5: Initialize the Database

1. **Run the Database Setup Script**:
   ```bash
   python core/db_setup.py
   ```
   - This script creates the `taskflow.db` SQLite database and initializes the schema.

### Step 6: Run Database Migrations (If Applicable)

- **Note**: If the project uses migrations (e.g., with Flask-Migrate or Alembic), run:
  ```bash
  flask db upgrade
  ```

### Step 7: Launch the Application

1. **Set the Flask Application Environment Variable**:
   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     set FLASK_APP=core/app.py
     ```
   - **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     export FLASK_APP=core/app.py
     ```

2. **Start the Flask Application**:
   ```bash
   flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000
   ```
   - The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

3. **Verify the Application is Running**:
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.
   - Ensure the login page or home page loads successfully.

## Production Configuration Details

### Database Setup

- **Database Engine**: SQLite (for local production).
- **Database File Location**: `core/taskflow.db`.
- **Permissions**: Ensure the application has read/write access to the database file.
- **Backup Strategy**: Regularly back up `taskflow.db` to prevent data loss.

### Environment Variables

- **FLASK_ENV**: Set to `production` to enable production settings.
- **SECRET_KEY**: A securely generated key for session management and security.
- **DATABASE_URL**: Specifies the database connection string.

### Logging Configuration

- **Log File Location**: `core/app.log`.
- **Logging Level**: Configure in `app.py` or the application's logging configuration file.
- **Permissions**: Ensure the application can write to the log file.

### Security Considerations

- **Session Security**: Keep `SECRET_KEY` confidential.
- **Dependency Management**: Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
  ```
- **Access Control**: Verify that all routes requiring authentication are properly protected.

## Post-Deployment Testing and Verification

### Functional Testing

Conduct the following tests to ensure the application functions correctly:

1. **User Authentication**:
   - **Register** a new user.
   - **Login** with the new credentials.
   - **Logout** and attempt to access a protected route.

2. **Task Management**:
   - **Create** a new task.
   - **Modify** an existing task.
   - **Delete** a task.
   - **Verify** that tasks appear correctly in lists and on the Kanban board.

3. **Kanban Board Functionality**:
   - **Drag and Drop** tasks between columns.
   - **Confirm** that task statuses update accordingly.

4. **Data Filtering and Search**:
   - Use filters and search functionality to **locate** specific tasks.

### Database Verification

1. **Data Integrity**:
   - Use a SQLite client to inspect `taskflow.db`.
   - **Verify** that all tables are present and correctly populated.

2. **Transaction Testing**:
   - Ensure that **create**, **read**, **update**, and **delete** (CRUD) operations reflect accurately in the database.

### Performance Testing

- **Response Time**: Ensure the application responds promptly to user actions.
- **Resource Utilization**: Monitor CPU and memory usage to identify potential bottlenecks.

### Security Testing

1. **Input Validation**:
   - Test forms with invalid or malicious inputs to ensure proper validation and error handling.

2. **Access Control**:
   - Attempt to access restricted resources without authentication to confirm security measures are effective.

3. **Session Management**:
   - Verify that sessions expire appropriately and that session data is secure.
