# Kanban Board Task Management System - Requirements

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a web-based Kanban board task management system for a grocery and consumer goods retailer with 28 points of sale. The system aims to enhance task management by transitioning from a static Excel spreadsheet to a more robust and scalable SQL database. The development follows Agile principles, focusing on delivering core functionalities iteratively while allowing flexibility for future enhancements.

## Stakeholder Requirements

### 1. Core Functionalities

The project will deliver a minimum viable product (MVP) that includes the following core functionalities, designed to meet the primary needs of the accounts payable department:

#### 1.1 Data Migration
- **Requirement 1.1.1:** Migrate existing tasks from an Excel workbook to an SQL database using SQLAlchemy. The workbook includes fields such as `Grocery Store/Headquarter`, `Task Title`, `Task Status`, `Task Priority`, `Grocery Store Location`, `Task Start Date`, `Task Finish Date`, and `Notes`.
- **Requirement 1.1.2:** Design a database schema that reflects the structure of the Excel workbook, establishing appropriate tables and relationships to support future enhancements.

#### 1.2 Task Management
- **Requirement 1.2.1:** Implement a web interface using Flask that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks.
- **Requirement 1.2.2:** Users should be able to:
  - **Create New Tasks:** Enter task details through a form, including title, status, priority, start and finish dates, location, and relevant notes.
  - **View Tasks:** Display tasks in a structured format with filtering options for ease of access.
  - **Update Tasks:** Modify existing task details, such as changing the task status or editing descriptions.
  - **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks from the database when they are no longer relevant.

#### 1.3 Querying and Filtering
- **Requirement 1.3.1:** Provide users with a query interface to filter tasks based on various criteria, including task status, start and finish dates, priority, and POS location.
- **Requirement 1.3.2:** Return a filtered list of tasks that match the selected criteria, facilitating effective task management and prioritization.

#### 1.4 Kanban Board Interface
- **Requirement 1.4.1:** Develop an interactive Kanban board interface that visually organizes tasks into columns based on their status (e.g., Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Done).
- **Requirement 1.4.2:** Integrate the Kanban board with the task filtering system to dynamically update based on user-selected criteria.
- **Requirement 1.4.3:** Display key task details (e.g., title, priority, dates) within the Kanban board for quick reference.
- **Requirement 1.4.4:** Ensure a user-friendly interface with clear visual distinctions between task statuses and priorities.

### 2. User Interface and Experience

The system should be designed with a focus on user-friendly interaction and accessibility, ensuring ease of use and efficient navigation.

#### 2.1 User Interface Design
- **Requirement 2.1.1:** Create a clean, responsive web interface with a consistent design across all pages, emphasizing usability.
- **Requirement 2.1.2:** Use visual elements like color-coding and layout to differentiate task statuses and priorities on the Kanban board.

#### 2.2 User Experience
- **Requirement 2.2.1:** Provide immediate feedback to users for all actions taken (e.g., task creation, updates, or deletion) to enhance user interaction.
- **Requirement 2.2.2:** Implement validation and error handling mechanisms to guide users and reduce the risk of incorrect data entry.

### 3. Agile Development and Future Enhancements

The project will follow Agile methodologies, focusing on iterative development, continuous feedback, and adaptability to changing requirements.

#### 3.1 Agile Iterations and Sprints
- **Requirement 3.1.1:** Divide the development process into sprints, each aimed at delivering a subset of the core functionalities.
- **Requirement 3.1.2:** Conduct sprint reviews and testing to ensure alignment with stakeholder requirements and identify areas for improvement.

#### 3.2 Future Enhancements
- **Requirement 3.2.1:** Design the system with scalability and flexibility in mind to accommodate future enhancements.
- **Potential Enhancements:**
  - **Drag-and-Drop Functionality:** Implement a feature to allow users to drag tasks between columns on the Kanban board.
  - **User Authentication:** Develop user accounts and role-based access control to secure the task management system.
  - **Advanced Reporting:** Enable the generation and export of reports based on task data for deeper insights.
  - **External Tool Integration:** Explore integrating with external tools such as Google Sheets, Trello, or email notifications for enhanced functionality.

#### 3.3 Documentation and Delivery
- **Requirement 3.3.1:** Provide comprehensive documentation, including a README file detailing project structure, setup instructions, and user guidance.
- **Requirement 3.3.2:** Record a video demonstration showcasing the projectâ€™s functionalities, as per the submission guidelines.
- **Requirement 3.3.3:** Submit the project following the CS50 edX submission process, with an open path for future development based on stakeholder feedback.

## Conclusion

The Kanban Board Task Management System is designed to provide an immediate and effective solution for managing tasks, transitioning from a spreadsheet-based system to a web-based application. By adopting Agile principles, the project emphasizes delivering core functionalities first while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements, ensuring a scalable and user-centric solution.
