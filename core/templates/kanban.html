<!-- kanban.html -->
{# 
    File: kanban.html
    Description: This is the main HTML template for the Kanban board feature in the task management application. 
    The template extends 'layout.html', providing a structured view of tasks categorized into different statuses 
    (e.g., Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Done) in a visual drag-and-drop board. The Kanban board is essential for 
    offering users an intuitive way to track and manage tasks through various stages of completion.

    Inputs: 
    - Extends the 'layout.html' file, which provides the common structure including header, footer, and navigation.
    - Includes '_sidebar.html' for filtering options and task navigation.
    - Includes '_kanban_board.html' for the actual Kanban board layout and task cards.

    Outputs:
    - Renders a full-page Kanban board within the layout defined in 'layout.html'.
    - Displays a sidebar with filtering options and a main section with the Kanban board.
    
    Dependencies and Correlations:
    - Depends on 'layout.html' for the overall page structure, ensuring consistent UI/UX across the application.
    - Uses '_sidebar.html' to incorporate filtering and navigation, allowing users to filter tasks displayed on the Kanban board.
    - Uses '_kanban_board.html' to render the Kanban board where tasks are categorized and can be moved between columns.
    
    Collaboration Note: 
    - Developed by Stefania Galatolo, with invaluable assistance from ChatGPT 4.0. In an unexpected twist of fate, ChatGPT became the Kanban master while Stefania heroically fought against endless divs and CSS classes. Together, they transformed chaos into a streamlined task management board.
