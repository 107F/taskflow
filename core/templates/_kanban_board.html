    Developed by Stefania Galatolo, with a sprinkle of magic from ChatGPT 4o.
    Description:
    - This file defines the Kanban board interface for the task management application.
    - It creates a visual board with four columns: Backlog, To Do, In Progress, and Done.
    - Tasks will be dynamically populated into these columns based on their status in the database.
    - Includes a "Due Today" button for filtering tasks that are due today.
    - Integrates with Sortable.js to provide drag-and-drop functionality for task cards.
    - References an external JavaScript file ('kanban.js') that contains the logic for dynamic rendering and updating of tasks.
    
    Interactions:
    - The board relies on the JavaScript file 'kanban.js' to handle:
        * Fetching tasks from the server using AJAX.
        * Populating the columns with task data.
        * Implementing drag-and-drop to move tasks between columns and update their status.
        * Filtering tasks due today when the "Due Today" button is clicked.
    - Sortable.js library is included for enhancing user interaction through drag-and-drop.
    - The tasks data is initially fetched from the server-side Flask route and rendered dynamically into each column.
    - Updates made on the board are sent back to the server to persist the changes in the database.
    
    Usage:
    - The user can interact with the Kanban board by dragging task cards between columns.
    - Clicking the "Due Today" button filters and displays tasks that have a due date set for today.
    - This template is part of the front-end interface and is essential for providing a visual representation of task statuses.

    Inputs:
    - Task data fetched from the server using JavaScript (from the database).
    
    Outputs:
    - Dynamic visual representation of tasks within the Kanban board columns.
    - Sends updates to the server when tasks are moved between columns.
