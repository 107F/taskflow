{# 
    Filename: create.html
    
    Description: 
    This template renders the "Create Task" page, providing an interface for the user to create a new task 
    and view the existing tasks in a tabular format. It extends the base layout (`layout.html`) and incorporates 
    several reusable components using Jinja2's include functionality.
    
    Template Structure:
    - Extends the base layout from "layout.html".
    - Sets the page title to "Create Task".
    - Renders the main content block which consists of:
        1. Sidebar: Includes "_sidebar.html" for displaying filter options.
        2. Main Content Area:
            - Header: Displays the title "Create Task".
            - Task Creation Form: Includes "_create_form.html" to provide the form for creating new tasks.
            - Tasks Table: Includes "_tasks_body.html" to render the current list of tasks in a table format.
    
    Correlations:
    - "_sidebar.html": Provides filter options, allowing users to interactively narrow down the displayed tasks.
    - "_create_form.html": Contains the form to create new tasks. When submitted, the form data is sent to the server 
      to create a new task entry in the database.
    - "_tasks_body.html": Displays a table of all current tasks. This template shows the task list without filters, 
      giving a straightforward overview of the tasks.

    Flow:
    1. User lands on the "Create Task" page.
    2. The sidebar is displayed on the left for filtering tasks.
    3. The main content area shows the task creation form at the top.
    4. Below the form, a table lists all tasks, allowing the user to see what tasks already exist.
