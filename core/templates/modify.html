    File: modify.html 
    
    Overview:
    - This template is part of the task management web app.
    - It's used to render the "Modify Task" page, which allows users to modify an existing task.
    - The page layout is divided into two main sections:
        1. Sidebar: For task filtering options.
        2. Main Content Area: For task modification and task list display.
    - This file interacts with several other components:
        - Extends `layout.html` to maintain a consistent look and feel across the app.
        - Includes `_sidebar.html` for task filtering options.
        - Includes `_modify_form.html` which contains the form to modify a task.
        - Includes `_tasks_body.html` to display a table of all tasks.
    
    Inputs:
    - This template does not directly accept user input but interacts with user inputs via the included `_modify_form.html`.
    
    Outputs:
    - Displays a form to modify task details and a table listing all current tasks.
    
    Correlation with Other Files:
    - The modifications submitted via the form in `_modify_form.html` are processed by the Flask route handling task modification (typically using a POST request).
    - `_tasks_body.html` dynamically displays tasks fetched from the database.
    - `layout.html` provides the overall page structure and common elements like the navbar.
    
    Flow:
    1. User navigates to the "Modify Task" page.
    2. Sidebar allows for filtering tasks (filters defined in `_sidebar.html`).
    3. User selects a task to modify via the form (`_modify_form.html`).
    4. User submits the form, which sends the modification to the server for processing.
    5. The task table (`_tasks_body.html`) displays the updated task list.
