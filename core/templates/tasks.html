    Developed by: Stefania Galatolo, with a bit of (much needed) magical assistance from ChatGPT 4.0 
    (because even the best developers need a little AI help sometimes ðŸ˜…).

    Description:
    This template extends 'layout.html' and is responsible for rendering the main tasks page of the web application.
    It is structured into two main sections:
    1. Sidebar Section: Includes a sidebar for filtering and navigating through the tasks. 
       This is included from the '_sidebar.html' partial template.
    2. Tasks Table Section: Displays the tasks in a structured table format.
       This section is included from the '_tasks_body.html' partial template.
    The main purpose of this template is to provide an interactive and organized view of all tasks,
    leveraging Bootstrap for responsive design. 

    Inputs:
    - None directly from this template. However, it relies on the '_sidebar.html' and '_tasks_body.html' 
      for their respective functionalities, such as filtering options and task display.

    Outputs:
    - Renders a responsive tasks page layout with a sidebar and a tasks table section.
    - The filtering actions in the sidebar will dynamically update the task list displayed in the tasks table section.

    Correlations with Other Files:
    - '_sidebar.html': Included for filtering tasks. This template contains various filtering options to help the user 
      refine the task list based on different criteria like POS, status, and priority.
    - '_tasks_body.html': Included for displaying the task list. It fetches and displays tasks in a structured table 
      format, providing a detailed view of each task's attributes.
    - 'layout.html': The base template which this template extends. It provides the overall structure and common elements 
      (like navigation bar and footer) for the page.
    
    Flow:
    1. The layout provided by 'layout.html' is extended to maintain a consistent design across the application.
    2. Within the 'main' block, the page is divided into two main sections using Bootstrap's grid system.
       a. The left section includes the sidebar, which allows users to filter tasks.
       b. The right section displays the tasks in a table format, updating based on the filters applied in the sidebar.
